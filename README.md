# vQModerator
vQModerator is the One-Stop extension if you want to use vQMod!
It handles the installing/updating of vQMod, and you can manage all your extensions.
You can also edit extensions, or if you're a developer generate your XML or Package files.
It fully integrates with OpenCart Modifications, so you can have the best of both worlds!

What you get:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- NEW!!! vQModerator Easy Update (Installs latest version from server)
- SUPER Easy installation of both vQMod and vQModerator (excellent for updating!)
- One-Click Install/Update vQMod from within vQModerator (Installs latest version from server)
- vQMods and OCMods Manager (Upload / Install / Download / Uninstall / Delete / Update)
- Clean Uninstall of new extensions (Keeps track of new files, and deletes them on uninstall)
- "Smart" vQMods Generator/Editor (inspired by vQGen by UKSB - http://www.opencart-extensions.co.uk)
- (Developers) Ability to add New Files (php,txt,tpl,jpg,png,gif....) to your Packages
- NEW!!! (Developers) Generate All mod files, and put in "tests folder" to compare against

The "Smart" vQMod & OCMod Generator has the following functionality:
- Includes all possible vQMod and OCMod settings (up to vQMod v2.5.1)
- You can add New Files to your packages! (Only works for OCMods or vQMods with vQModerator!!)
- Rather clearly shows what you need to set/what's gonna happen
- Autocompletes the "File" field (click for next dir, until you reach your file)
- Checks if the "Search" string exists in "File"! (and reports how often)
- Possible to check "Search" string in Multiple OpenCart versions!
- Automagically shows/hides possible inputs, depending on selection
- You can show/hide all files and operations (for better overview)
- Code highlighting for "Add" field (Also very "editable" inside the Generator)

This extension tries to write/delete files from the server (both for vQMod Install/Update and Extensions with new files).
For that, you need to set your FTP settings.
